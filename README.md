# Data Visualisation Resources

See resources at: [nrennie.rbind.io/data-viz-resources](https://nrennie.rbind.io/data-viz-resources/).

## Adding or editing a resource

* Please make a pull request with an edit to the `resources.csv` file. 
* Ensure all four columns are complete.
  * `Type`: valid options are `Blog`, `Book`, `Newsletter`, `Website`, `Community`, `Data`, `Challenge`, `Video`, or `Podcast`. If a resource fits into multiple `Type` categories, please choose the one that fits best. 
  * `Name`: the name of the resource e.g. Who's blog is it? Or what is the name of the book?
  * `Link`: the full URL to the resource. Links should generally be to the main resource page e.g. link to a blog rather than a single blog post, or a YouTube channel rather than a single video.
  * `Category`: the category of the resource e.g. the programming language, or area of data visualisation covered. Resources may have multiple categories, which should be separated by a semi-colon, `;`. Current categories include `Blog`, `Newsletter`, `Community`, `R`, `Python`, `D3`, and `Svelte`. If you are adding a new category, please explain why in your PR description.
