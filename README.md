# Data Visualisation Resources

See resources at: [nrennie.rbind.io/data-viz-resources](https://nrennie.rbind.io/data-viz-resources/).

## Adding or editing a resource

* Please make a pull request with an edit to the `resources.csv` file. 
* Ensure all four columns are complete.
  * `Category`: valid options are `General`, `Accessibility`, `Colour`, `Conference`, `Data viz community`, `Data viz people`, `Visual perception`, `Newsletter`, `Programming`, `Resource list`, `Style guide`, `Viz software`, or `Inspiration`. If a resource fits into multiple `Topic` categories, please choose the one that fits best. 
  * `Name`: the name of the resource e.g. Who's blog is it? Or what is the name of the book?
  * `Link`: the full URL to the resource. Links should generally be to the main resource page e.g. link to a blog rather than a single blog post, or a YouTube channel rather than a single video.
  * `Notes`: Notes about the resource e.g. the programming language, or area of data visualisation covered. Resources may have multiple categories, which should be separated by a semi-colon, `;`.
